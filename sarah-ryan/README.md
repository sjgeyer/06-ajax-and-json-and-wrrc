# jQuery AJAX & JSON

**Author**: Ryan and Sarah
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application uses ajax to grab the local storage data and render it into the blog. If local storage does not exist, it will put the data from the attached json file and render that data onto the HTML and push to local storage.

## Getting Started
The user must add a function that checks if local storage exists and if not, pull the data from the file, and if so, grab it from local storage and render it to the HTML.

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, and AJAX.

## Change Log
03-20-2018 11:09:00am - Application now renders articles to HTML with or without local storage present.
